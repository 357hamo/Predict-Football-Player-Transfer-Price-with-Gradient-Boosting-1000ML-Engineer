### Predict-Football-Player-Transfer-Price-with-Gradient-Boosting-1000ML-Engineer
This project is part of Machine Learning Track at the 1000ML Engineer initiative and aims to predict football player  transfer value using Gradient Boosting algorithm.

 The project utilizes a dataset containing historical football transfer records and player attributes. By analyzing the dataset,.

 The project builds a machine learning model to predict player transfer values, which can help football clubs to make informed decisions while buying and selling players.
